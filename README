This is the begining of a multiplatform Tower Defense game. It currently is under
development by the collabrative efforts of Kevin G. and Andrew H. Some key points
of this Tower Defense are as follows:
  o) It will be 3d allowing for very nice tower graphics.
  o) It will be (as stated previously) multiplatform. All platforms and Android will be supported.

PS: Artists are welcome and appreciated. My Blender skills are... in development. ~aedon
